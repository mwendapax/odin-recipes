    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
            <li>Cook the Pasta:</li>
            <ul>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
                    <li>Add the fettuccine pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente.</li>
                    <li>Drain the pasta, reserving about 1/2 cup of the pasta water, and set aside.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Prepare the Chicken:</li>
            <ul>
                    <li>Season the thinly sliced chicken breasts with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning.</li>
                    <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
                    <li>Add the seasoned chicken slices to the skillet and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 5-6 minutes per side.</li>
                    <li>Once cooked, remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Make the Alfredo Sauce:</li>
            <ul>
                    <li>In the same skillet used to cook the chicken, melt the butter over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
                    <li>Pour in the heavy cream and bring to a simmer.</li>
                    <li>Reduce the heat to low and gradually whisk in the grated Parmesan cheese until smooth and creamy.</li>
                    <li>Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                    <li>If the sauce is too thick, you can add some of the reserved pasta water to reach your desired consistency.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Combine Pasta, Chicken, and Sauce:</li>
            <ul>
                    <li>Add the cooked fettuccine pasta to the skillet with the Alfredo sauce.</li>
                    <li>Toss the pasta gently until it is well coated with the sauce.</li>
                    <li>Slice the cooked chicken breasts into strips and add them to the skillet with the pasta and sauce.</li>
                    <li>Gently toss everything together until the chicken and pasta are evenly distributed and coated with the Alfredo sauce.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Serve:</li>
            <ul>
